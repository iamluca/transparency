    Hello,
    I am so sorry about using your name and profile on discord server. I just
    typed names for marketplace on google and eluxum market was my choice. Then
    I typed that in google and it showed me your logo which I used. I didn't
    know it was copyrighted. I changed logo and name moment i received message
    on discord. Again, I am very sorry for this.
